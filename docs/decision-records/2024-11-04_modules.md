## Context
The "Map My World" application backend is designed to support the exploration and review of various locations and
categories, such as restaurants, parks, and museums. Users interact with an interactive map where they can discover
new locations and receive recommendations based on specific categories. One of the primary goals is to ensure that
recommendations remain relevant and up-to-date, showing places that users may not have reviewed recently.

The project involves building a REST API using Python and FastAPI that supports:
1. **Location and Category Management**: Providing functionality for users to add new locations and categories.
2. **Exploration Recommendation**: Implementing an endpoint to suggest location-category combinations that havenâ€™t been
3. reviewed in the past 30 days, with priority given to locations that have never been reviewed.

Given these requirements, we must structure the application into logical modules that will promote clarity, enable
maintainability, and support future scalability. Each module needs to be designed with enough independence to function
as a standalone service if the logic within the module grows significantly.

## Considerations
The following factors are critical when defining the module structure:

- **Scalability**: Each module should encapsulate specific business logic to support independent growth and potential
  scaling. This modular structure will allow each component to be separated into standalone services if necessary.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Organizing the application into modules based on domain responsibilities will help keep
  the codebase manageable and promote adherence to single-responsibility principles.
- **Reusability of Common Code**: A dedicated `common` module will be used to store shared resources like utility
  functions, base classes, and reusable value objects. This will prevent duplication and encourage consistency across
  modules.
- **Efficient Geospatial and Recommendation Queries**: The modules should support efficient data retrieval,
  particularly for geospatial queries and recommendations that prioritize freshness (last reviewed within 30 days) and
  novelty (never reviewed).

## Decision

The application will be organized into the following modules:

1. **Common**: 
   - Contains shared code and reusable resources, such as utility functions, value objects, and base classes
     (e.g., `DomainException`, `Service`, `Repository`). 
   - This module promotes consistency and prevents code duplication across the system, providing a foundation for shared
     components.

2. **Recommendation**:
   - Encapsulates the business logic for generating recommendations for location-category combinations.
   - Supports the main recommendation feature by identifying places that have not been reviewed recently, ensuring that
     recommendations are both relevant and fresh.

3. **GeoQuerier**:
   - Manages geospatial queries for places, including searching by location coordinates and retrieving location-specific
     data.
   - This module will optimize the data retrieval needed for the map view, allowing users to explore nearby places based
     on their current location or other geospatial parameters.

4. **PlaceManager**:
   - Responsible for creating, validating, and persisting places, categories, and reviews.
   - Ensures data integrity by validating inputs and managing relationships between places, categories, and review
     records.

## Consequences

- **Positive Outcomes**:
  - **Scalable Architecture**: Each module encapsulates specific functionality, allowing for potential scaling and
    independent deployment of modules in the future.
  - **Code Reusability and Consistency**: The `common` module standardizes utility functions and base classes, reducing
    code duplication and enhancing maintainability.
  - **Improved Query Efficiency**: By isolating geospatial and recommendation logic in dedicated modules, we can
    optimize queries for each use case, improving performance.
  - **Clearer Separation of Business Logic**: Each module follows single-responsibility principles, simplifying code
    maintenance and enhancing readability for developers.

- **Potential Challenges**:
  - **Inter-Module Communication**: As modules evolve, ensuring efficient communication between modules (e.g., passing
    data from `GeoQuerier` to `Recommendation`) may require additional infrastructure, such as APIs or message queues.
  - **Dependency Management**: Dependencies in the `common` module must be carefully managed to avoid tight coupling
    that could affect modular independence.
  - **Deployment Complexity**: If modules are scaled independently, additional orchestration will be needed to manage
    versioning and deployment processes for each module.
