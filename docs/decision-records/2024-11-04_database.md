## Context
The project focuses on writing reviews for categorized places defined by geospatial coordinates
(latitude and longitude). The system requires an API to retrieve places to display on a map, methods for adding places
and categories, and functionality to recommend places that have not been reviewed in the last 30 days. The primary data
throughput involves querying geospatial data, necessitating a database solution that excels in this area, has a 
good performance with CRUD operations and a sharding out-of-the-box for growing datasets.

## Considerations
In selecting a database, we evaluated several options based on their geospatial capabilities, performance, flexibility
in handling document structures, and ability to perform complex queries and aggregations. Key considerations included:

- Native support for geospatial data types and queries.
- Capability to handle common document structures for reviews and categories.
- Support for simple relationship queries to link places with their categories.
- The ability to perform aggregation operations for data analysis, such as clustering.

## Decision

### Candidates
- **MongoDB**
- ElasticSearch
- PostGIS
- RedisGEO

### Use MongoDB for Geospatial Data Management
MongoDB was selected due to its native support for geospatial data, allowing for efficient querying and
indexing of locations. Its document-oriented structure facilitates handling a variety of data types, including reviews
and categories, in a flexible manner. The database supports straightforward relationship queries, which aligns well
with the project's requirements. Additionally, MongoDBâ€™s powerful aggregation framework enables complex data
operations, such as implementing the k-means clustering algorithm for location analysis and recommendations.

## Consequences
- **Positive Outcomes**:
  - Improved performance for geospatial queries, enabling quick retrieval of relevant locations for the map interface.
  - Flexibility in data modeling, allowing easy adjustments to the schema as project requirements evolve.
  - Enhanced capabilities for analyzing data through aggregation operations, facilitating advanced features like
    location clustering.
  
- **Potential Challenges**:
  - While MongoDB handles simple relationships well, more complex relational data management may require additional
    considerations or workarounds.
  - The need to ensure data integrity during concurrent operations, given MongoDB's eventual consistency model.
